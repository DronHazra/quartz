## heuristic evaluation of ikea
1. Visibility of system status:
   I denied it my location, and it told me that it was "guessing" the location. That's pretty good. 
2. Match between system and real world
   They have products both split by room and type with lots of pictures of products in real world scenarios, and you can directly buy products from the real-world photos â€” very strong match. 
3. User control and freedom
   There are lots of filtering/comparison options, letting you compare along most axes that you'd want to compare on. 
4. consistency and standards
   Consistent theming for each menu item and product, font shared across pages, menu bar stays sticky across pages.
5. error prevention
   
6. recognition rather than recall
7. flexibility and efficency of use
8. aesthetic and minimalist design
9. help users recognize and recover from erros
10. help and documentation

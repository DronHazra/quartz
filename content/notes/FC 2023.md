## map of machine learning:

 - machine learning models are probability models
	 - specifying a random variable, and then fitting a relevant distribution
 - causal models as the future of ML?

## AI and algorithms
 - gnns:
	 - permutation invariant functions of features of nodes and their neighbourhoods
 - training gnns to execute classical algorithms
	 - in particular: infinite data
	 - clearly specified generating function
	 - (seemingly easy — and yet)
 - [[notes/What can neural networks reason about]]
 - gnns align with dynamic programmin
	 - distances are node features
	 - minimizing is aggregation
	 - relaxation is summing?
 - [[Neural execution of graph algorithms]]
	 - easy to overfit 
	 - shared layer that iterates (arbitrary input sizes)
	 - encode-process-produce
	 - using a relevant aggregation (sum vs max)
	 - step-wise supervision
		 - checking your work
 - [[Neural turing machine]]?
 - how is this useful?
	 - algorithmically aligned models accelerate science
	 - approximating np-hard problems
 - [[A generalist neural algorithmic learner]]

## bayesian machine learning
 - we need a empricial approximation of risk
	 - that doesn't require knowing the data distribution $\mathcal{D}$
 - problems occur on two axes
	 - assumptions/knowledge, and data
	 - max data (have everything we would ever want to predict on) (lookup table)
	 - $L_{\mathcal{S}} A(\mathcal{S}) := \frac{}{}$
	 - algorithm $A$ that generates hypotheses $h$ over a finite set $\mathcal{H}$
 - SGD changes hypothesis finder
 - data augmentation is changing sample
 - parametrize knowledge $$p(f) = \int p(f | x=x_i, y=y_j)p(x,y)dx, y$$
 - knowledge about the points 
 - prediction of $p(g) = \int p(f | x) dp(x)$

## eric michaud and grokking
 - to generalize on an arithmetic dataset, networks *must* perform that computation somehow internally
 - [[LU mechanism]] — leads to grokking
	 - weight norms
	 - finding something in parameter (weight) space, and then finding this goldilocks zone
 - [[Omnigrok Grokking Beyond Algorithmic Data]]

title: "issues with the cambridge cs course"
---

i want to separate the quality of teaching with the content itself — lecturers should be given some degree of pedagogical license to teach courses the way they want. this should ideally just focus on what is theoretically taught.

## an "abstract and theoretical" course

that's why i chose cambridge cs. i did a lot of olympiad math in high school, and i wanted something to satisfy that problem-solving part of my background. also, that's kind of what i want out of my university education. i don't expect to learn lots of things i will apply in my future job or career or whatever, but learning the abstract stuff feels very powerful and fun.

so tell me, what % of the first-year courses would you expect to provide some kind of theoretical foundations? 75%? 50%? 

try 30%. that's being a *little* harsh, discounting the math entirely. if i were to judge it fairly, i'd say it's closer to 40%. but still, look at the list of courses:

 - **foundations of computer science**
 - **object-oriented programming**
 - **intro to probability**
 - **algorithms 1 and 2**
 - **digital electronics**
 - operating systems 
 - software and security engineering
 - **discrete math**
 - databases
 - introduction to graphics
 - interaction design
 - machine learning and real-world data
 - "mathematics for the natural sciences"

i want to compare this to the other school i was considering, university of waterloo software engineering:

-   [CS 137](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/CS/137) – Programming Principles
-   [ECE 105](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/ECE/105) – Classical Mechanics
-   [MATH 115](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/MATH/115) – Linear Algebra for Engineering
-   [MATH 117](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/MATH/117) – Calculus 1 for Engineering
-   [MATH 135](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/MATH/135) – Algebra for Honours Mathematics
-   [SE 101](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/SE/101) – Introductions to Methods of Software Engineering
-  [CS 138](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/CS/138) – Introduction to Data Abstraction and Implementation
-   [ECE 106](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/ECE/106) – Electricity and Magnetism
-   [ECE 124](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/ECE/124) – Digital Circuits and Systems
-   [ECE 140](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/ECE/140) – Linear Circuits
-   [MATH 119](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/MATH/119) – Calculus 2 for Engineering
-   [SE 102](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/SE/102) – Seminar

it looks... almost the same. except a couple key differences:

 - a full course in linear algebra
 -
